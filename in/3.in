"Free Software" means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. With these freedoms, the users (both individually and collectively) control the program and what it does for them.
When users don't control the program, the program controls the users. The developer controls the program, and through it controls the users. This nonfree or "proprietary" program is therefore an instrument of unjust power.
Thus, "free software" is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of "free" as in "free speech," not as in "free beer".
